# Day-4-git
IMT 511 day 4 project with git
This is just a demo repo for this class
Here is where I would put my fucks if I had any

Here is the time where we are learning how to do this over and over again


We are trying to make sure we understand how to do this

gitHub is pretty cool


import turtle
t = turtle.Pen()
for x in range (100):
    t.forward(x)
    t.left(100)
    t.right(50)
    
Here is the code for a hexagon thing in the turtle cool thing
I like doing that part. I need to learn how to do colors
